# hw1-markup

This is the submission for the semantic/markup assignment for the first week.

## About

This project was to edit the pre-built landing page to be more accessibility friendly and flow easier by editing the already existing elements to be semantic. The goal was to leave the general use and design of the site the same, and to solely fix the HTML.

## Note

I ended up downloading a screen reader just for this assignment, but I think I'll end up using it in the future as well. I ran it over the page a few times, and it was a very informational experience to see how they worked and would read the elements.
