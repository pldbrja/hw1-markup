# hw1-markup

This is the submission for the semantic/markup assignment for the first week.

## Note

I ended up downloading a screen reader just for this assignment, but I think I'll end up using it in the future as well. I ran it over the page a few times, and it was a very informational experience to see how they worked and would read the elements.
